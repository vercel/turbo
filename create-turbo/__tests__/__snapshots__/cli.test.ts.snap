">>> Bootstrapped a new turborepo with the following:

 - apps/web: Next.js with TypeScript
- apps/docs: Next.js with TypeScript
 - packages/ui: Shared React component library
 - packages/config: Shared configuration (ESLint)
- packages/tsconfig: Shared TypeScript \`tsconfig.json\`
>>> Success! Created a new Turborepo at \\"my-turborepo\\".
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn run build
     Build all apps and packages
yarn run dev
     Develop all apps and packages

Turborepo will cache locally by default. For an additional
speed boost, enable Remote Caching (beta) with Vercel by
entering the following command:

  npx turbo login

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-turborepo
  npx turbo login"
