Turborepo 1.11 completes the migration to Rust and ships several developer experience improvements:

- [**Rust port completed**](#unlocking-the-future-of-turbo-with-rust): We've finished the port from Go to lay the groundwork for better performance, improved stability, and new features.
- [**Group logs for improved readability**](#group-logs-for-improved-readability): You can now specify `--log-order=grouped` to organize your logs into distinct sections separated by tasks.
- [**Updated examples**](#updated-examples): Start with an example for Next.js, Svelte, Remix, Nuxt, and more.
- [**Tighter feedback loops in your editor** <ExperimentalBadge isLink={false} />](#tighter-feedback-loops-in-your-editor-experimental): Find errors in your Turborepo configuration without leaving your IDE.

Update today by running `npx @turbo/codemod migrate`.

## Unlocking the future of `turbo` with Rust

As we wrote about in [our blog post about the migration](https://vercel.com/blog/turborepo-migration-go-rust), we're excited to start seeing the benefits of our porting effort for Turborepo users. Rust has allowed us to surface more complexity in _our_ code so we're able to create a better experience in _your_ codebase in several ways:

- We've noticed a slight performance improvement for the majority of use cases, even without doing much performance tuning in our code yet. We look forward to diving deeper into making `turbo` even faster soon.
- We've been able to catch possible bugs much sooner, as Rust forces us to think about the differences between platforms and environments much more closely than Go.
- The Rust ecosystem has many powerful crates that served our needs well, showcasing the ecosystem alignment we were lacking in Go.

If you find any problems that you believe are related to the new Rust codepath, you can opt back to the Go codepath using the `--go-fallback` flag and [report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%3A+bug%2Cowned-by%3A+turborepo%2Cneeds%3A+triage&projects=&template=0-turborepo-bug-report.yml&title=%5Bturborepo%5D+).

## Group logs for improved readability

To make it easier to review your task logs, we've introduced the `--log-order` flag to output all logs from a task **after it finishes** rather than _as it writes_. This results in logs that are separated per-task, improving legibility on a specific task's logs.

<ThemeAwareImage
  className="my-4 flex justify-center"
  light={{
    alt: 'Using `--log-order=grouped` to output task logs to the terminal as separated chunks separated by task.',
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-11-0/log-order-groups-light.png',
    props: {
      width: 682,
      height: 746.5,
      className: "dark:hidden block rounded-xl"
    }
  }}
  dark={{
    alt: 'Using `--log-order=grouped` to output task logs to the terminal as separated chunks separated by task.',
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-11-0/log-order-groups-dark.png',
    props: {
      width: 682,
      height: 746.5,
      className: "hidden dark:block rounded-xl"
    }
  }}
/>

Enable this behavior using `--log-order=grouped`.

## Updated examples

Our repository contains [`an examples folder`](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples) with starter single-workspace monorepos for your projects.

To get started with an example, run:

```bash
# Uses the with-basic example
npx create-turbo@latest
```

```bash
# Next.js and Remix
npx create-turbo@latest -e kitchen-sink
```

```bash
# Vue and Nuxt
npx create-turbo@latest -e with-vue-nuxt
```

We're putting a renewed effort towards ensuring our examples are kept up-to-date. Additionally, we've re-architected our examples to advocate for best practices in monorepos.

Check out [the examples folder](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples) for more.

## Tighter feedback loops in your editor <ExperimentalBadge>Experimental</ExperimentalBadge>

A language server protocol (LSP) gives you the earliest feedback possible by showing you possible issues in your code while you write it.

TODO: demo photo

This experimental version of Turbo LSP helps you get the most out of Turborepo with in-editor tips like:

- Intellisense for packages and tasks
- Warning diagnostics on missing tasks and packages
- A codemod to quickly fix deprecated syntax in `turbo.json`

Try it out today by...TODO.

## Community

Since releasing [Turborepo 1.10](/blog/turbo-1-10-16) we've seen incredible adoption and community growth:

- [23.5k+ GitHub Stars](https://github.com/vercel/turbo)
- [1.8M+ weekly NPM downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turbo)
- 196 years of compute time saved using [Vercel Remote Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/remote-caching)

Turborepo is the result of the combined work of all of its contributors, including our core team.

Thank you for your continued support, feedback, and collaboration to make Turborepo your build tool of choice.
