Turborepo 1.6 changes the game for Turborepo - you can now use it for **any project**, monorepo or not.

- [**Turborepo in non-monorepos**](#the-monorepo-handbook): Seeing slow builds on your project? You can now use Turborepo to speed up builds in any codebase with a `package.json`.

Update today by running `npm install turbo@latest`.

## Any codebase can use Turborepo

Turborepo helps speed up tasks in your codebase. Until now, we'd built Turborepo specifically for monorepos - codebases which contain multiple applications and packages.

Turborepo is awesome in monorepos because they have so many tasks to handle. Each package and app needs to be built, linted, and tested.

But we got to thinking: lots of codebases that _aren't_ monorepos run plenty of tasks. Most CI/CD processes do a lot of duplicated work that would benefit from a [cache](/docs/core-concepts/caching).

So we're excited to announce that **any codebase can now use Turborepo**. Try out our [new quickstart](/docs/getting-started/add-to-project) to get Turbo running on your non-monorepo project.
