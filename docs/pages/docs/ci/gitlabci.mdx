# Using Turborepo with GitLab CI

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

```yaml
image: node:latest
# To use Remote Caching, uncomment the next lines and follow the steps below.
# variables:
#   TURBO_TOKEN: $TURBO_TOKEN
#   TURBO_TEAM: $TURBO_TEAM
stages:
  - build
build:
  stage: build
  before_script:
    - curl -f https://get.pnpm.io/v6.16.js | node - add --global pnpm@7.0.0-rc.9
    - pnpm config set store-dir .pnpm-store
  script:
    - pnpm install
    - pnpm build
  cache:
    key: "$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
    paths:
      - .pnpm-store
```

> For more information visit the pnpm documenation section on GitLab CI integration, view it [here](https://pnpm.io/continuous-integration#gitlab)

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with GitLab CI, add the following environment variables to your GitLab CI project.

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your GitLab repository settings and click on the **Settings** and then **CI/CD** tab. Create a new variable called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL (or if you're on Hobby, your personal URL works as well). Do not include the `https://vercel.com/` part, only the slug.
