# Using Turborepo with Travis CI

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

Create a file called `.travis.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - lts/*
cache:
  npm: false
  directories:
    - "~/.pnpm-store"
before_install:
  - curl -f https://get.pnpm.io/v6.16.js | node - add --global pnpm@7.0.0-rc.9
  - pnpm config set store-dir ~/.pnpm-store
install:
  - pnpm install
script:
  - pnpm run test
```

> For more information visit the pnpm documenation section on Travis CI integration, view it [here](https://pnpm.io/continuous-integration#travis)

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with Travis CI, add the following environment variables to your Travis CI project.

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your Travis repository settings and scroll down to the _Environment Variables_ section. Create a new variable called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL (or if you're on Hobby, your personal URL works as well). Do not include the `https://vercel.com/` part, only the slug.
