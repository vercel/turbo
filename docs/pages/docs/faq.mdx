# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I have to use remote caching to use Turborepo?

No. Remote caching is optional. However, you find it very useful to speed up development on a team, speed up builds inside of Docker, and also save space on your own machine.

## Does Turborepo store my source code?

No. Turborepo does not store source code. Without remote caching, no code ever leaves your machine—it will only cache artifacts to local disk.

With Turborepo's remote caching, you are responsible for configuring cache behavior and should only setup Turborepo to cache compiled artifacts. Please be awareS that Turborepo treats all logs as artifacts and so these _will_ be stored along with other cache artifacts. There is also a retention period of 14 days. In the future, this retention period will be configurable on a per-task basis.

## Is Turborepo secure?

Yes, we take security extremely seriously.

- Without remote caching, there is no movement or storage of code (either source or compiled) anywhere other than to the local disk cache.
- With remote caching enabled, Turborepo only ever caches what you configure it to (compiled artifacts and logs), not underlying source code. Turborepo.com has a cache a retention period of 14 days. In the future, this will be configurable on a per task basis. All remote cache artifacts and logs are encrypted at rest and only ever transferred via SSL. Lastly, each organization has a completely isolated AWS subaccount.
- Turborepo's hashes (the way it indexes an artifact) are modeled after git's hashes and so the chance of a collision is almost non-existent. Furthermore, since we isolate each customer's artifacts in separate AWS subaccounts, in the event of a hash collision, the impact would be immaterial.
- We are currently undergoing both SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance audits via Secureframe.

If the above answers do not satisfy or meet your security requirements, we do have a self-hosted version of Turborepo available for enterprise customers. However it is a bit slower (200-700ms slower per hop) than our self-service cloud offering because we run our cache instances at the edge (~20-50ms). This doesn’t matter too much at the moment, but as we release new features in the future, this latency difference may become more noticeable.
