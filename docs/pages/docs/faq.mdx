# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I have to use Remote Caching to use Turborepo?

No. [Remote Caching](./features/remote-caching) is optional. However, you'll find it very useful to speed up development on a team, speed up builds inside of Docker, and also save space on your own machine.

## Does Turborepo / Remote Caching store my source code?

No. Turborepo does not store source code. Without Remote Caching, no code ever leaves your machineâ€”it will only cache artifacts to local disk.

With Turborepo's Remote Caching, you are responsible for configuring cache behavior and should only set up Turborepo to cache compiled artifacts. Please be aware that Turborepo treats all logs as artifacts and so these _will_ be stored along with other cache artifacts. There is also a retention period of 14 days. In the future, this retention period will be configurable on a per-task basis.
