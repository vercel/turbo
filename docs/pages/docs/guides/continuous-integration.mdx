# Continuous Integration

Turborepo not only speeds up builds, but also your CI pipeline. Below are a few ways to use Turborepo with various Continuous Integration providers.

## GitHub Actions

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with GitHub Actions and pnpm.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  build:
      name: Build and Test
      timeout-minutes: 15
      runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
      # To use Remote Caching, uncomment the next lines and follow the steps below.
      # env:
      #  TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
      #  TURBO_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}
      strategy:
        matrix:
          os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]

      steps:
        - name: Check out code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
          with:
            fetch-depth: 2

        - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2.0.1
          with:
            version: 6.32.2

        - name: Setup Node.js environment
          uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: 16
            cache: pnpm

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: pnpm install

        - name: Test
          run: pnpm turbo run test
```

#### Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with GitHub Actions, add the following environment variables to your GitHub Actions workflow
and make them available to your `turbo` commands.

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-tokens.png)
![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-create-token.png)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your GitHub repository settings and click on the **Secrets** and then **Actions** tab. Create a new secret called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

![GitHub Secrets Create](/images/docs/github-actions-create-secret.png)

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL (or if you're on Hobby, your personal URL works as well). Do not include `https://vercel.com` part, but only the slug.

4. At the top of your GitHub Actions workflow, provide the following environment variables to jobs that use `turbo`:

```yaml highlight="6-8"
# ...

jobs:
  build:
      name: Build and Test
      timeout-minutes: 15
      runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
      # To use Turborepo Remote Caching, set the following environment variables for the job.
      env:
        TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
        TURBO_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}
      strategy:
        matrix:
          os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]

      steps:
        - name: Check out code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
          with:
            fetch-depth: 2
      # ...
```

## CircleCI

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with CircleCI and yarn.

Start by creating a `.circleci/config.yml` file

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@5.0.2
workflows:
  test:
    jobs:
      - test
jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:lts
    # To use Remote Caching, uncomment the next lines and follow the steps below.
    # environment:
    #  TURBO_TOKEN: $TURBO_TOKEN
    #  TURBO_TEAM: $TURBO_TEAM
    steps:
      - checkout
      - node/install-packages:
          pkg-manager: yarn
      - run:
          command: yarn turbo run test
```

#### Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with CircleCI, add the following environment variables to your CircleCI workflow
and make them available to your `turbo` commands.

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your CirclCI project settings and click on the **Environment Variables** tab. Create a new secret called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

![CircleCI Create Environment Variables](/images/docs/circleci-create-environment-variables.png)

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL (or if you're on Hobby, your personal URL works as well). Do not include `https://vercel.com` part, but only the slug.

    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:lts
    environment:
      TURBO_TOKEN: $TURBO_TOKEN
      TURBO_TEAM: $TURBO_TEAM
    steps:
      # ...
```
