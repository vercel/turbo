# Invalid Environment Variable Prefix

When declaring environment variables in your `turbo.json`, you cannot prefix them with `$`. This
was an old syntax for declaring a dependency on an environment variable that is no longer used.

## Example

```json
{
  "globalEnv": ["$MY_ENV_VAR"]
}
```

## Solution

Remove the `$` prefix from your environment variable declaration.

```json
{
  "globalEnv": ["MY_ENV_VAR"]
}
```
