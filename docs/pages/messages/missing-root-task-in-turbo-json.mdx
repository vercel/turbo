# Missing root task in turbo.json

## Why This Error Occurred

We call the scripts defined in the monorepo's root `package.json` the root tasks. These tasks often call `turbo`
themselves. For example:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build"
  }
}
```

This creates a problem when we declare task dependencies with `^`. A quick recap, `^<task>` means all of the `<task>`
entries in the package's dependencies, e.g. if package `a` depends on packages `b` and `c`, and `a#build` depends on
`^build`, then its dependencies will be `b#build` and `c#build`. We call these topological dependencies. Topological
dependencies work well for many common situations, such as when you want to build your dependencies before building
your own package.

```json turbo.json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

However, following package dependency relations is slightly problematic because the root package is an implicit dependency
for all the packages inside the monorepo. If you're wondering why that is, well, it wasn't our choice. This is just
how JavaScript monorepos work. If you define a dependency in the root `package.json`, it becomes available to all
packages in the monorepo.

Therefore, if we were to follow `^build` literally, it'd cause an infinite loop, because we'd execute the root `build`
task, which would execute `turbo`, which would execute `^build`...and so on. Instead of wasting everybody's time,
we decided that `turbo` would not execute root tasks by default.

## Solution

As long as the root task does _not_ call `turbo`, you can add it to the `pipeline` field in `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "//#build": {}
  }
}
```

This will permit tasks to depend on `//#build`.

However, if the root task does call `turbo`, this can cause infinite recursion. In this case, we don't recommend depending
on the root task. Instead, you can determine the tasks that this root task depends on, and depend on those directly.
For instance, if `//#build` depends on `app#lint` and `docs#lint`, then you can declare those as dependencies.
