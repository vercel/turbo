# Missing root task in turbo.json

## Why This Error Occurred

Scripts defined in the monorepo's root `package.json`, i.e. root tasks, often call `turbo` themselves.
For example:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build"
  }
}
```

This creates a problem when we declare task dependencies with `^`. A quick recap, `^<task>` declares that the
task depends on the same task in the package's dependencies, e.g. if package `a` depends on packages `b` and `c`,
and `a#build` depends on `^build`, then its dependencies will be `b#build` and `c#build`. We call these topological
dependencies.

However, this creates a problem, because the root package is an implicit dependency for all the packages
inside the monorepo.

```json turbo.json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

Therefore, by default, Turborepo does not include root tasks in its task dependency graph.

## Solution

As long as the root task does _not_ call `turbo`, you can add it to the `pipeline` field in `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "//#build": {}
  }
}
```

This will allow other tasks to depend on `//#build`.

However, if the root task does call `turbo`, this can cause infinite recursion. In this case, we don't recommend depending
on the root task. Instead, you can determine the tasks that this root task depends on, and depend on those directly.
For instance, if `//#build` depends on `app#lint` and `docs#lint`, then you can declare those as dependencies
