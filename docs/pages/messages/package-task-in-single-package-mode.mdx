# Package Task In Single Package Mode

In single package mode, there cannot be multiple packages in your repository. Therefore, declaring a task in the
`turbo.json` with a specified package name is not permitted.

## Example

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "app#build": {
      "cache": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution

Remove the package name from the task declaration.

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "cache": true
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can disable single package mode by [specifying the workspaces in the repository](/repo/docs/getting-started/existing-monorepo#configure-workspaces).
