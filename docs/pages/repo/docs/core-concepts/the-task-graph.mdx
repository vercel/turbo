# The Task Graph

Underneath the hood Turborepo identifies the set of work that must be done and the order in which it must happen. Learning how to think about the world as a series of tasks that have dependencies enables you to optimize your code tremendously.

As an example of the power and complexity of the system let's review a few different testing workflows and how you would define them to optimize your build times.

## Unit Testing - Single Package

The primary hallmark of unit tests is that they happen at the smallest possible level. In a unit test you can imagine that it's entirely possible that the complexity is low enough that you would not need to run a build in order to
