# Using environment variables

We currently recommend using `dotenv-cli` as the simplest way to bring your environment variables into your development tasks.

We're actively looking forward to improving the developer experience and ergonomics for your environment variables in a future release of Turborepo.

## Guide

1. Place all of your variables into the root of your monorepo as a `.env` file.

2. Install `dotenv-cli` into the root of your repository.

```json
{
   "devDependencies": {
+    "dotenv-cli": "latest"
  }
}
```

3. Adjust your scripts to inject the environment variables into the `turbo` command.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "dotenv -- turbo dev"
  }
}
```
