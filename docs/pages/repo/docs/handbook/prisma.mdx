# Using Prisma with Turborepo

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an extremely popular ORM with automated migrations, type safety and integrated tooling.

## Guide

### 1. Create your Monorepo

If you don't have an existing project, use our [quickstart](/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new) to create a new monorepo.

### 2. Add a new `database` package

Create a new folder called `database` inside packages with a `package.json` inside:

```json filename="packages/database/package.json"
{
  "name": "database",
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "latest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Replace "latest" with the latest version
    "prisma": "latest"
  }
}
```

If you're using `pnpm`, you should add a file at the root called `.npmrc`:

```txt filename=".npmrc"
public-hoist-pattern[]=*prisma*
```

Run your package manager's install step to install the new dependencies.

### 3. Run `prisma init`

`cd` into `packages/database`:

```bash
cd packages/database
```

Run `npx prisma init`.

This should create several files inside `packages/db`:

```
prisma/schema.prisma
.gitignore
.env
```
