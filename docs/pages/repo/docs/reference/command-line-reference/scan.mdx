# `turbo scan`

Enable the fastest defaults for your Turborepo with one, interactive command.

You'll be taken through a short series of steps to enable the fastest settings for your Turborepo while you're working locally. These optimizations include:

- **Git FS Monitor**: `turbo` leans on Git to do file change discovery. Since we have to wait for `git` to tell us about changes, we can use [Git's built-in filesystem monitor](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsmonitor--daemon) to get those notifications sooner.
- **Turbo Daemon**: Turborepo has a daemon to do work for optimistically understanding your repository in the background. By doing the shared, common work that `turbo` will need to do when you run your tasks beforehand, we can make `turbo` much faster.
- **Remote Caching**: While Turborepo can cache your work locally, it can also share a cache across all of your machines. Enabling [Remote Caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) makes your caching **multiplayer**, ensuring that you, your teammates, and your CI machines, never do the same work twice.
- **Check `turbo` version**: We're always working towards making `turbo` better. To ensure you are using the latest version of Turborepo, we'll check your version and remind you to install `latest` if you aren't using it yet.
- **Check for Turborepo LSP**: If you are using Turborepo LSP, we'll check if it's running and remind you to start it if it's not.

## LSP

Visit the [VSCode Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vercel.turbo-vsc) and install the Turborepo LSP extension for your code editor.

## Git FS Monitor

The Git FS Monitor is a feature that allows Git to notify `turbo` about file changes faster. This can make `turbo` faster by reducing the time it takes to discover file changes. We'll enable this feature for you.
It does this by speeding up `git status` which is used by `turbo` to discover file changes.
