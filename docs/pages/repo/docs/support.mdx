## Support Policy

`turbo` is generally supported on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows on both x86_64 and ARM 64 architectures.
Specificaly, we build and ship the following binaries via `npm`:

- turbo-darwin-64
- turbo-darwin-arm64
- turbo-linux-64
- turbo-linux-arm64
- turbo-windows-64
- turbo-windows-arm64

The darwin builds are intended for macOS on Intel and Apple Silicon. The linux
builds are intended to run on Ubuntu, but we do not exercise them on other
distros. The windows builds are tested on the [`windows-latest` runner][2] in
Github Actions.

## Node.js Compatibility

Most core `turbo` functionality (especially `turbo run`) does not depend on the
active Node.js version on your system, but som features of Turborepo and its ecosystem
such as `create-turbo`, `turbo-ignore`, and `eslint-plugin-turbo` do. For these features,
we intend to support the [Active and Maintenance LTS versions of Node.js][1].

## Package Managers

Core `turbo` functionality depends on the package managers in the JS ecosystem
and their implementations of workspace configuration (in monorepos) and
lockfiles formats. We intend to support:

- `npm` (v6+)
- `yarn` (v1+)
- `pnpm` (v6+)
- `bun` (v1+)

It should be noted that Package Managers themselves have their own release
schedules, bugs, and features. While we intend to keep up with new major
versions, we may not release support immediately.

## Releases

Turborepo "loosely" follows SemVer policy. This means that we generally do not
expect to make intentional "breaking" changes in patch or minor versions.

Some exceptions to this may be:

- Configuration changes in `turbo.json`.

  These should usually be accompanied by a codemod that you can run with
  `npx @turbo/codemd update` and with at least one minor release that includes a
  deprecation message.

- Intentional behavioral changes to of `turbo`'s CLI commands.

  These should land in minor releases. If the change is large or disruptive enough, we may
  include flags to opt into the previous behavior.
