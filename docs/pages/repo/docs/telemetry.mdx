# Telemetry

Vercel Inc. (Vercel) may collect anonymous telemetry data about your use of Turborepo as explained below.
Telemetry data allows us to monitor and improve Truborepo and the Vercel platform by collecting data about its
usage and host information. The data may be used to identify, troubleshoot, or respond to issues
that impact users.

Participation in this anonymous program is optional, if you do not want telemetry data collected, you may opt-out (see below).

## Why

Telemetry allows us to accurately gauge Turborepo feature usage, pain points, and customization across all users.
This data enables us to better tailor Turborepo to the masses, ensuring its continued growth, relevance, and best-in-class developer experience.
Furthermore, this data allows us to verify if improvements are improving the baseline of all applications.

## What is collected

We track general usage information, Specifically, we track the following anonymously:

- Command invoked ([turbo run](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/run), [turbo prune](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/prune), [turbo gen](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/gen), etc.)
- Version of `turbo`
- General machine information (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux, whether or not the command was run within CI)
- Size of application (total number of workspaces)

- We **DO NOT** track task names, arguments, or flag values.

**Note**: This list is regularly audited to ensure its accuracy.

You can view exactly what is being collected by setting the following environment variable: `TURBO_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1`.

Additionally, all possible events can be viewed by browsing the [events](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/crates/turborepo-telemetry/src/events.rs) file directly.

## How Do I Opt-Out?

### Disable

You may opt out-by running:

```sh
turbo telemetry disable
```

You may also opt-out by setting the `TURBO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` environment variable. Turbrepo also
respects [Console Do Not Track (DNT)](https://consoledonottrack.com/) and can be disabled by setting the
`DO_NOT_TRACK=1` environment variable.

### Status

You may check the status of telemetry collection at any time by running:

```sh
