# Telemetry

Turborepo collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
Participation in this anonymous program is optional, and you may opt-out if you'd not like to share any information.

## Why

Telemetry allows us to accurately gauge Turborepo feature usage, pain points, and customization across all users.
This data will let us better tailor Turborepo to the masses, ensuring its continued growth, relevance, and best-in-class developer experience.
Furthermore, this will allow us to verify if improvements are improving the baseline of all applications.

## What is collected

We track general usage information, Specifically, we track the following anonymously:

- Command invoked ([turbo run](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/run), [turbo prune](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/prune), [turbo gen](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/gen), etc.) - we **DO NOT** track task names, arguments, or flag values.
- Version of `turbo`
- General machine information (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux, whether or not the command was run within CI)
- Size of application (total number of workspaces)

**Note**: This list is regularly audited to ensure its accuracy.

You can view exactly what is being collected by setting the following environment variable: `TURBO_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1`.

Additionally, all possible events can be viewed by browsing the [events](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/crates/turborepo-telemetry/src/events.rs) file directly.

## How Do I Opt-Out?

### Disable

You may opt out-by running:

```sh
turbo telemetry disable
```

You may also opt-out by setting the `TURBO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` environment variable. Turbrepo also
respects [Console Do Not Track (DNT)](https://consoledonottrack.com/) and can be disabled by setting the
`DO_NOT_TRACK=1` environment variable.

### Status

You may check the status of telemetry collection at any time by running:

```sh
turbo telemetry status
```

### Enable

You may re-enable telemetry if you'd like to re-join the program by running the following:

```sh
turbo telemetry enable
```
