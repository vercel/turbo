# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter turborepo.

## What's inside?

This turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `database`: [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) ORM wrapper to manage & access your database
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) for database ORM
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for local database

## Setup

This repository is used in the `npx create-turbo@latest` command, and selected when choosing which package manager you wish to use with your monorepo (Yarn).

### Database

We use [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) to manage & access our database. As such you will need a database for this project, either locally or hosted in the cloud.

To make this process eaasier, we offer a [`docker-compose.yml`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file to deploy a MySQL server locally with a new database named `turborepo` (To change this update the `MYSQL_DATABASE` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file):

```bash
cd my-turborepo
docker-compose up -d
```

Once deployed you will need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in order for Prisma to have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to access.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If you added a custom database name, or use a cloud based database, you will need to update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` accordingly.

Once deployed & up & running, you will need to create & deploy migrations to your database to add the necessary tables. This can be done using [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate):

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

For further more information on migrations & how to use Prisma Migrate, we recommend rad through the [Prisma Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate).

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
cd my-turborepo
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
cd my-turborepo
yarn run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching (Beta)](https://turborepo.org/docs/features/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching (Beta) you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```bash
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```bash
npx turbo link
```
