# Turborepo Codemods

Turborepo provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your Turborepo codebase when a feature is deprecated.

Codemods are transformations that run on your codebase programmatically. This allows for a large amount of changes to be applied without having to manually go through every file.

## Adding new transformers

Run `pnpm add-transformer`, or [view the complete guide](./src/transforms/README.md).
